Welcome to ODIN II version 0.1 - the better High level synthesis tools++ targetting FPGAs (mainly VPR)
Email: jamieson.peter@gmail.com and ken@unb.ca for support issues

Reading Configuration file
Reading FPGA Architecture file
--------------------------------------------------------------------
High-level synthesis Begin
Parser starting - we'll create an abstract syntax tree. Note this tree can be viewed using Grap Viz (see documentation)
Adding file syn2.v to parse list
Optimizing module by AST based optimizations
Converting AST into a Netlist. Note this netlist can be viewed using GraphViz (see documentation)
==========================
Detected Top Level Module: 	syn2
==========================
Performing Optimizations of the Netlist
Performing Partial Map to target device
Outputting the netlist to the specified output format
Successful High-level synthesis by Odin
	Blif file available at syn2.odin.blif
	Ran in 2.7s
